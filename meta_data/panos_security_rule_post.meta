module: panos_security_rule_post
short_description: Create security rule (post rules) policy on Panorama management console.
description: >
    - Security policies allow you to enforce rules and take action, and can be as general or specific as needed. The
    policy rules are compared against the incoming traffic in sequence, and because the first rule that matches the
    traffic is applied, the more specific rules must precede the more general ones.

    - pan-python can be obtained from PyPi U(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pan-python)
    - pandevice can be obtained from PyPi U(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandevice)
